# QtHeadFootball
This project is supposed to be a game in which both character are controlled by the keyboard, the first problem is that Qt seems to only be able to focus on one at the time.
The second problem is the collide of the soccer ball with the boundaries, I have not written the code for the colliding with the players yet because I wanted to 
figure out the boundaries first since it is the same logic.
Another problem is the jumping of the character, it is almost there but I couldn't figure out where is the bug. The jump works just fine is I keep the Key_Up pressed when 
it should work by only pressing once. (This features is not as important I can just not implement jumping at all.)
